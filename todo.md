## ToDo

* Swap out Paperclip for AWS to host user profile pictures.
* Give user more search run options and more run results.
* Refactor controllers and views across entire app
* Move towards separate backend and front-end, where the backend would be built as a Rails API, and the front-end with React.
* Rethink how meetingpoint is calculated
* Move towards a mobile application as opposed to a web app that is responsive on a phone. Potential frameworks: React Native, Swift
